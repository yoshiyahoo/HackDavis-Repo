*   Explain the concepts of nodes, data, and pointers in the context of linked lists.
*   Describe the basic operations on a linked list:  traversal, insertion, and deletion.
*   Identify the advantages and disadvantages of using linked lists compared to arrays.
*   Recognize real-world scenarios where linked lists are applicable.

**3. Overview / Introduction (5 minutes)**

*   **Hook:** Start with a relatable scenario. "Imagine you're organizing a scavenger hunt, and each clue leads to the next.  That's similar to how a linked list works â€“ each item *points* to the next."
*   **What is a Data Structure?:** Briefly explain that data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
*   **Introduce Linked Lists:**  Explain that a linked list is a fundamental data structure that is a sequence of *nodes*.
*   **Contrast with Arrays:** Briefly mention Arrays as another common data structure, stating that linked lists are different and have their own pros and cons.

**4. Key Concepts Explained in Simple Terms (10 minutes)**

*   **Node:** (Followed by the full lesson content...)`;
