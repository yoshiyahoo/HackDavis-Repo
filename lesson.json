  "name": "Linked Lists",
  "lesson": "Linked Lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science. Unlike arrays, linked lists don't store elements in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each element (called a node) contains both data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the sequence.\n\nKey concepts of linked lists:\n\n1. Node: The basic building block of a linked list, containing data and a pointer to the next node.\n\n2. Head: The first node in a linked list, used as the starting point for traversal.\n\n3. Tail: The last node in a linked list, whose pointer is typically null.\n\n4. Traversal: The process of visiting each node in the linked list, starting from the head and following the pointers.\n\n5. Insertion: Adding a new node to the linked list, which can be done at the beginning, end, or middle.\n\n6. Deletion: Removing a node from the linked list, which requires updating pointers.\n\nAdvantages of linked lists:\n- Dynamic size (can grow or shrink during execution)\n- Efficient insertion and deletion operations\n- No need for contiguous memory allocation\n\nDisadvantages:\n- Random access is not allowed (must traverse from head)\n- Extra memory for storing pointers\n- Not cache-friendly due to non-contiguous memory\n\nTypes of linked lists include:\n- Singly linked lists (each node points to the next node)\n- Doubly linked lists (each node points to both next and previous nodes)\n- Circular linked lists (last node points back to the first node)\n\nLinked lists are commonly used in implementing stacks, queues, graphs, and other complex data structures."
